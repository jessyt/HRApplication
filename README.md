# HRApplication
To run the application:
(NOTE) Check out the "Python Test Data" below - this will populate the application

1. On the root directory, run "npm install" in a terminal
2. Then in the terminal, run "npm start". This should start the backend.
3. Next, navigate to 'HRApplication/frontend'. Run "npm start" here and that should kick off the front end. 


# HRApplication postman collection
I just included this so that you can test out the 4 endpoints that are in the program. To test these, import the collection to postman and run at the root directory of this folder "npm start"

## Python Test Data
I would suggest running this before running the app so it has some data in the collection
1. Run pip install pymongo
2. Run pip install "pymongo[srv]"
3. Run python .\testData.py
